golang 版本 [https://github.com/weibaohui/k8m](https://github.com/weibaohui/k8m)

A Kubernetes management tool written in C# Blazor, integrating the ChatGPT large models. 
It features a user-friendly interface for easy and efficient Kubernetes administration. 
Particularly suitable for beginners, it offers various convenient functionalities to help novices grasp Kubernetes knowledge.


* Colorful and intuitive display of Kubernetes resources.
* Yaml-defined fields are analyzed and displayed in a tree structure, accompanied by documentation. Additionally, translation using a large model is available, eliminating concerns about forgetting definitions.
* Detailed explanations of Kubernetes resource fields, ensuring no ambiguity about the number of options and their meanings.Official documentation with clickable links.
* Integration of official examples in a directory tree format, allowing easy browsing, reference, and field copying.
* Support efficient editing of YAML resources, enabling writing YAML fields on one side of the page while referring to field definitions at the same time.
* Support displaying corresponding Service and Ingress on the Pod page, and support displaying backend Pods on the Service and Ingress pages.
* Generation of Yaml 、Problem analysis、Security checks using a large model.
* Support conversational k8s functionality operations, such as semantic commands to check the running status of pods in the default namespace.
* Display resource usage dynamically (requires installation of metric server), and support viewing detailed statistical data* Integration of page functionalities such as kubectl describe, kubectl explain, kubectl top and other high-frequency commands. These can be accessed with a simple click on the user interface.
* Inspection functionality added to the cluster page, conducting common error checks on major resource objects and providing detailed lists.
* Supports Chinese, English, as well as French, German, Italian, Russian, Spanish, French, Japanese, Korean, and 12  languages.
* Visualize the relationships and states between workload resources intuitively through a topology diagram.
* Supports GatewayAPI, including GatewayClass, Gateway, HTTPRoute, GRPCRoute, TCPRoute, and UDPRoute.
* Support using Mermaid.js to visualize HttpRoute resources, which is intuitive and clear.

# k8s install

Create a small Kubernetes cluster using [KinD](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/)、[MiniKube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)

## KinD way

* install KinD on mac with `brew`.
```
brew install kind
```

* Create a new Kubernetes cluster. 

```
kind create cluster --name k8sgpt-demo
```

#  Deploy BlazorK8s to a cluster and experience it:

## kubectl apply yaml

```docker
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weibaohui/blazork8s/main/deploy/deployment.yaml
```

* View the ui：
  By default, it uses NodePort for access. Please visit port 31999, or configure Ingress on your own.
  http://NodePortIP:31999 (!Do not use 127.0.0.1/localhost!)

## Start a Docker image to experience it
### x86 Run
Note: When using Docker Desktop, you need to handle the access domain address of the API server yourself. Ensure that it is accessible within the Docker environment.
```docker
docker run -it --rm    -v ~/.kube/:/root/.kube/ -p 4000:8080 ghcr.io/weibaohui/blazork8s:0.2.7
```
### ARM Run (Mac M1/2/3)
```docker
docker run -it --rm    -v ~/.kube/:/root/.kube/ -p 4000:8080 ghcr.io/weibaohui/blazork8s:0.2.7-arm
```

* View：http://IP:4000 (!Do not use 127.0.0.1/localhost!)

# Debug

```
 git clone git@github.com:weibaohui/blazork8s.git
 cd blazork8s/BlazorApp
 dotnet watch run
```
# Interface Language Configuration
The interface defaults to displaying in Chinese. To set a default display in another language, modify the `appsettings.json` in the source code's `BlazorApp` directory or the image's `/app/appsettings.json`.
```
